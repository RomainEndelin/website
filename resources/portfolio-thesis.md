My PhD thesis was in the field of Ambient Assisted Living (helping frail people in their daily life, with smart environments and sensors).
Elderly people are not able to deal with complex interface, so our system must adapt to the user (rather than the user adapting to the system). This is why we create an ubiquitous computer, where the inputs come from sensors rather than keyboards.
Data received from sensors have no structure at first, but we make information emerge from it, to recognize human activities, detect risks, and notify the right person about it.

I have contributed to the following achievements:

* Creating a physical platform to be deployed in smart home, based on a Linux distribution in a 35$ credit-card sized Raspberry Pi. Reliability was a strong criteria, as the Internet connection was often unstable. I made this platform easily reproducible, through the Ansible provisioning tool.
* We installed this platform in several houses, and several rooms in a nursing home.
* We developed a web application to receive the sensor events, process them, visualize activities, administrate the platforms, and send alert. (using the Sails.JS framework).
* I created a flexible prototyping environment for data analysis, using Jupyter (formerly known as IPython) and the Python Scientific Stack.

My major scientific contribution is the validation and improvement of our reasoning process for activity recognition. To do so, I have redesigned our model of activities as a hierarchy, and I have measured the accuracy of our reasoning engine, based on several sources of ground-truth knowledge.

I had the chance to tutor directly two interns (and five other interns remotely, to Singapore), always with very positive feedback.

I have also been extremely active in the laboratory's life, I have had many contact with the nursing home crew, and with elderly people themselves, and I attended several conferences and events.
