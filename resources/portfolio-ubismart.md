Ubismart is a complex web application for the **Internet of Things**. My team and I developed it during my PhD thesis.
It is built with **Node.js** and **Sails.js**.

It features Machine-to-Machine communication (using **MQTT**), Data Visualization (**D3.js**), ontological reasoning, etc.

### Ubigate

**Ubigate** is the counterpart of Ubismart. It is developed in **Python**, and installed on a **Raspberry Pi**, inside a **smart-home**. To provision the Raspberry Pi, I have used a powerful DevOps tool: **Ansible**.
