It is a framework for **rapid prototyping** and **data science** for activity recognition in smart-home application.

It is developed in Python, making heavy use of **Python Scientific stack**. It includes the following libraries:

* Jupyter (development environment)
* Numpy/Scipy (mathematical functions)
* Pandas (data analysis)
* Bokeh (data visualization)
* RDFlib / RDFAlchemy (Ontological Model)
